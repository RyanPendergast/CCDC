Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides encryption and authentication for network communications. 
To install and configure TLS on Fedora, you can follow these steps:
sudo dnf install openssl
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 10 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/example.key -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/example.crt
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/example.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/example.key
