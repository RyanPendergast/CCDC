Open the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security console. You can do this by 
searching for "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" in the Start menu.

Click on "Inbound Rules" in the left-hand menu.

Click on "New Rule" in the right-hand menu to create a new inbound rule.

Select "Custom" as the rule type and click "Next".

Select "All programs" and click "Next".

Select "Protocol type" as the type of protocol you want to filter. You can choose from TCP, 
UDP, ICMP, or any other protocol that your server requires. Click "Next".

Select "Local IP address" as the scope of the rule. This should be the IP address of the server 
that the rule will apply to. Click "Next".

Select "These IP addresses" as the remote IP address. This will limit the rule to only apply to
packets coming from a specific IP address or range. Enter the IP address or range you want to allow 
in the "This IP address or subnet" field. Click "Next".

Select "Allow the connection" and click "Next".

Select the appropriate network type for the rule. If the server is connected to a domain network,
choose "Domain". If it's connected to a private or public network, choose the appropriate option.
Click "Next".

Give the rule a name and description that clearly indicates the purpose of the rule. Click "Finish" 
to create the rule.

Repeat steps 3-11 for each protocol and IP address range that you want to allow inbound traffic from.
