Go to the Start menu, click on the Settings icon (gear-shaped icon), and select "Update & Security".

Select "Device encryption" from the left-hand menu.

If your device meets the hardware requirements for BitLocker, you will see the option to turn on device encryption. If this option is 
not available, your device may not support BitLocker.

If you want to use BitLocker on a drive other than the system drive, you can enable BitLocker by right-clicking the drive in File Explorer,
selecting "Turn on BitLocker", and following the on-screen instructions.

If you want to use BitLocker to encrypt the system drive, click on "Manage BitLocker" in the "Device encryption" menu.

Click on "Turn on BitLocker" and follow the on-screen instructions to set up BitLocker, including choosing a password or smart card.

Once you have set up BitLocker, your drive will be encrypted and protected by a password or smart card.
