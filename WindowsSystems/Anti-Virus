Download the latest version of ClamAV for Windows from the official website (https://www.clamav.net/downloads#otherversions).

Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the file to a folder on your computer.

Open a Command Prompt window with administrator privileges. To do this, right-click the Start button and select "Command Prompt (Admin)".

Navigate to the folder where you extracted the ClamAV files using the "cd" command. For example, if you extracted the files to the
"C:\ClamAV" folder, type "cd C:\ClamAV" in the Command Prompt window.

Run the "freshclam" command to update the virus database. Type "freshclam" and press Enter.

Once the virus database is updated, run the "clamscan" command to scan your computer for viruses. Type "clamscan -r C:" and press Enter
to scan the entire C drive.

To turn on real-time scanning, you can use a third-party program such as Clam Sentinel, which is designed to work with ClamAV on Windows.
You can download Clam Sentinel from the ClamAV website (https://www.clamav.net/downloads#unofficial).

Once you have installed Clam Sentinel, open the program and select "Real Time Scanning" from the menu.

Click the "Enable" button to turn on real-time scanning
