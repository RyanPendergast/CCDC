Decode the captured packet in Wireshark and describe what the captured packets represent (ex: TCP connection for SMTP etc...) 

Open the captured packet in Wireshark by selecting "File" > "Open" and choosing the packet capture file.

The first step is to identify the protocol being used. This can be done by looking at the protocol column of the packet
details pane. The protocol column will tell you the protocol being used for that packet. For example, if the protocol column
shows "TCP", then the packet is using the TCP protocol.

Once you have identified the protocol being used, you can further analyze the packet to determine the type of traffic. For example,
if the protocol is TCP, you can determine if the traffic is part of a HTTP, FTP, or SMTP connection by looking at the source and destination
port numbers. HTTP traffic typically uses port 80, FTP traffic uses port 21, and SMTP traffic uses port 25.

You can also look at the packet details to determine the content of the packet. For example, if the packet is part of an HTTP connection,
you can look at the HTTP header to see the HTTP request and response messages.

Additionally, Wireshark can often provide additional information about the captured packets by using various analysis tools. For example, 
you can use the "Follow TCP Stream" option to view the entire TCP stream for a particular connection.
